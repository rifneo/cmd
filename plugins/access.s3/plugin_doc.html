    <b>Disclaimer:</b> If you installed Pydio by the linux repository ( apt / yum ), you must install the "pydio-plugin-access.s3" adn the "pydio-plugin-metastore.s3" package before.
</p>
<p>Use Amazon Simple Storage S3 as a file container. This extension should work out-of-the-box in Pydio 7, as we package
    the AWS SDK for PHP v3 directly.
</p>
<p>
    To be able to access an S3 storage, you will have to use the API keys provided on your Amazon console.
