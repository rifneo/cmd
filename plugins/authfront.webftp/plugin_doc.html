    See auth.ftp plugin: provide a rich login screen with full connection to an FTP server (host, port, credentials, etc...)
    and dynamically authenticate these credentials against this server. Coupled with a "Dynamic" FTP workspace, this is used
    to setup Pydio as a simple WebFTP application.
