    Implements "watch" system for files and folders.

<p>
    This plugin is using the underlying MetaStore to attach watch metadata to any node of a workspace, and hooks to the nodes events
    (node.read, node.change) to create and post notifications to the concerned users. Make sure to add a Metastore to the workspace.
