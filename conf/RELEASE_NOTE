---- PYDIO 8.0.0

This is major UX release.

[Full UI Rewrite]

User interface has been entirely rewritten, providing cutting-edge design principles (Material Design, by Google) on top of cutting-edge technologies. It's the best UX we've done, ever, and it's strong, stable, laid on solid fundations.
Of course, this bold move allowed us to improve many features, some of them are described below.

[Shares Tracking and Activity Reports]

Public links, that are by definition 'public', can now be personalized to track more finely who is accessing a link. Send invitation enabling the new tracking tool and each user will receive a slightly different link.
In their dashboard, users now have a way to easily summarize all their shared data, by workspace or share type. On the admin side, this share explorer allows for auditing the platform and easily finding mistakes or anomalies.

[Efficient Address-book and Teams Management]

The team concept of Pydio 7 has been deeply improved, allowing the users to easily manage their teams, share files or folder with them, and have the permissions updated automatically when team members are added or removed.
This is done through a brand new Address Book component, that gives access to the whole users directories.

[Enriched Admin UX]

Reaffirming Pydio's commitment to open source, we have brought back the Enterprise Distribution design for the admin dashboard in the Community edition. Pydio proves to be the most advanced open source solution for businesses and larger scale users.

[New features for the Enterprise Distribution]

- EasyTransfer is a way for organizations to provide super simple "upload-and-share" interface to their users, in a beautiful UX while maintaining data safe.
- The Branding Tool has been reworked to provide a more consistent way of changing the application colors.
- Administrators now have access to an instant search-engine for plugins and parameters accross the admin dashboard.
- Get started shortly with Pydio by simply importing a CSV file containing users.
... And many more!
