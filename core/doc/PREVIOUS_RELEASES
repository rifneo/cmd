New Features
**************

[Pydio Booster]

Pydio Go is a complement to Pydio that runs as a Server. It is based on GO, a performant language developed by Google. It will improve overall software performances, by delegating CPU-consuming task to this new tool. In this first version, it will handle uploads, scheduler triggers, and best of all, one-click install websocket server, which will especially improve scalability and performances by pushing events from server instead of polling all the time.
Pydio Go is available for Pydio Community and Pydio Enterprise.

[File Gateway improves your server security]

Pydio offers a brand new SaaS-based service called FileGateway, a host proxy to send public links without disclosing your server URL. Choose your domain name (filesend.cc / yoursha.re) and your region (US / EU).
Online Documents Edition

By hosting your own instance of Libreoffice Online from Collabora and using our new connector, you can now edit any office documents directly online, without the need to use third-party services like Zoho.

[API, Performances]

- Full rewrite of Pydio API, especially regarding provisioning, following Open API standards; there is now an extensive, accurate API REST documentation.
- Increased caching, especially files list, whick makes it mindblasting in terms of performances, especially for remote workspaces like S3 or FTP
- Search for files or information across several storages / workspaces at the same time, and get quicker search results with the upgrade of our Elastic Search plugin
- New Admin parameter to easily allow or prevent user to re-share files

[Under the Hood]

- Code refactoring, with PSR-7 pattern, Composer, Guzzle
- New Messaging Server based on NSQ, a language originally developed by Bitly
- Auto-complete command line makes it easier for Admins to look for specific actions with Pydio (thanks to @symfony)
- End of some unmaintained plugins (e.g. auth.serial, conf.serial)
- Internal router embeded solves deployment issues, simplifying RewriteRules at maximum
- New way of storing shares that will facilitate Pydio migrations
And many more... !!

****************
Migration Checks
****************

Appart from the Pydio core code, in-app upgrade process has modified a couple of resources. If you encountered any error, here is a list of the specific changes in this version.
Database Upgraded: you can verify that the following new tables were created : ajxp_tasks, ajxp_tasks_nodes, ajxp_mq_queues
.htaccess file updated : the RewriteRules are now greatly simplified.
Public links are now served directly from the /public/ endpoint. For backward compatibility, the file /data/public/share.php should have been modified as well. Please verify that your links are still working correctly.
/conf/bootstrap_*.php files were modified. If you have any changes, they may have been overriden.
S3 plugin now embeds its own Aws SDK. Plugin configuration should have been switched to v3 automatically.

Pydio Core 6.4.1 - Bug Fixes for 6.4

Pydio Core 6.4.1 fixes most blocking issues revealed by the massive upgrade to 6.4.0. Installation is done via the "Stable" update channel in-app, or via Linux packages manager depending on your installation mode.

[Overview]
Many issues fixed in shares, linked to the deep refactoring of this feature. Amongst others, the "shorten" plugins were broken.
* UI : Missing close button on some new dialogs, mobile display of the web UI was a little buggy
* CMS Bridges where broken due to an issue in the glueCode.php file

----
Pydio 6.4.0 is a stable release introducing many important new features!

Installation is done via the "Stable" update channel in-app.
Noticeable changes

Sharing Deeply Reworked
 * Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
 * Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
 * Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
 * Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.
CacheService mechanism : extension of our previous work with in-memory cache to support many types of key-value stores (apc, memcache, reddis, etc..). We are using the well-established Doctrine Cache component.
WebDAV access driver was entirely rewritten using Guzzle
Amazon S3 Access Driver: improved, we now support PHP-SDK v2 and v3. Hook to our Cache Service for better performances.

---------------

Pydio 6.3.1 is a development release introducing many important new features! As its name implies, it is NOT production-ready yet. However, the more you help us testing and you report issues, the quicker we will be able to transform it into a stable 6.4.

Please use Github to submit issues, making as sure as possible to submit only issues linked to this new release : regression of existing features, or problems with the new ones. Enjoy!
It's also a good time to help on translations with the new strings! Thanks for all your contributions.

Installation is done via the "Development" update channel in-app. They will not be any Linux Packages released for that version.
Noticeable changes

Sharing Deeply Reworked:
Ability to now share files with other users (without creating necessarily a public link)
Ability to toggle the visibility of a share inside a common workspace, to let other users edit this share
Implementation of the Federated Sharing API to allow sharing files and folders accross Pydio instances, and with other software providers implementing this API (currently OwnCloud).
Rework of the share panel, with direct-click for copy, better expiration date visualisation, and many more
UI transitioning smoothly to Material Design and ReactJS: following our previous work on the Enterprise Distribution with Material Design guidelines, and listening to your feedback about the UI. Changes are subtle (no big reorganization), but interface should be really clearer.
Mails Digest : avoid receiving tons of emails when watching for a file or folder modification, and opt-in for an hourly/daily/weekly based digest instead.
CacheService mechanism : extension of our previous work with in-memory cache to support many types of key-value stores (apc, memcache, reddis, etc..). We are using the well-established Doctrine Cache component.
WebDAV access driver was entirely rewritten using Guzzle
Amazon S3 Access Driver: improved, we now support PHP-SDK v2 and v3. Hook to our Cache Service for better performances.
Known Issues

Again, it's a dev release. There are some limitations that you should be aware of.
Internet Explorer Limited support : IE11/Edge should go pretty well, others, mmm, not sure :-)

[Summary]

Pydio 6.2.0 brings massive performance improvements, many bug fixes from previous version, and a couple of new features:
 * Performances: we gained an average 5 times in performance on every request. Using optional in-memory KeyValue Caching adds a tremendous improvement for Rest calls (sync).
 * Tar gz / bz2 support: creation and extraction of archives
 * Web UI: Better mobile support. Under the hood, we started migrating our whole JS platform from legacy libraries to Ecma Script 6. We now use Grunt tasks to compile/minify the JS
 * Packaging: Rework of our Linux packages from ground up, splitting plugins into separate packages, with packaging best-practice in mind.
 * PHP7-Ready: we chased language issues that could compatibility problems with PHP7.
 * And many many bug fixed on all parts of the application, see Changelog below.

Contributors: cdujeu, svetlemodry, rimckenney, c12simple, Isma91, leobouilloux, huzergackl, DepaMarco, ecappa, sespivak, Uggy, sim1st. Thanks to all for making this happen!

[Upgrade notes: please read]

. This new version now requires a php version greater or equal to 5.4. We also dropped support for IE7. Yes we did. Make sure that you meet these requirements before upgrading!
. If you are using the meta.mount plugin, we removed entirely the "sudo" options for security reasons. If you were relying on that, you will have to hack-it-yourself.
. The ROOT_ROLE was replaced by a "Root Group" role concept: a role corresponding to the root of all groups, and as such applied automatically to every users.

For archive deployments, upgrade should be straightforward, but for Linux make sure to check our online How-To.

## Core & Performances
Core performances: . AJXP_Controller: Minimize xPath calls by implementating a hookCache . AJXP_Plugin: reduce serialization - AJXP_PluginService: Try to use cache for softLoad operation (still return a cloned version of the cached plugin) . AJXP_Utils: cache the result of cleanDibiDriverParameters() function as it is called many times. (details)
Fix OS detection - Add iPad & iPhone (details)
RunTests: Fix apiPost function() (details)
If a client is posting bad parameters, it can end up copying a file into itself. (details)
Revert the automatic switch to MySQLi, add a parameter instead. (details)

Fix various issues with Forget Password action - Fix #863 (details)
Prevent some plugins to be disabled - Close #873 (details)

Pydio 5.3.3 Release Note

This is a development release, but it is already pretty stable, and hopefully next one will be final.
Upgrading is available on dev channel from both last dev release (5.3.2) and last stable release (5.2.3):
upgrading from v5.2.3 stable should be done in a staging environment only, but would it be helpful to test
it and report us feedbacks about migration process.

Date: Sept, 20th 2014
License: Affero GPL
Copyright: Charles du Jeu 2014
Upgrade: No-upgrade available yet from stable branch, please deploy separately. In-app upgrade from previous dev branch
Contributors: c12simple, mtskar, DepaMarco, smandon, matsimon, echampet, C. Biamont, P. Lundin

[Summary]

New orbit theme stabilisation - JS perfs optimizations
Object backends drivers upgrades :
- S3: Use more recent AWS SDK version for S3, make the plugin more flexible to easily speak with S3-compatible storages. Tested on Ceph storage.
- Swift: Replaced deprecated access.hpcloud by access.swift using openstack-sdk-php library
Extended new GraphViewer editor for logs analytics dashboard
Stabilisation of the new sharing engine
Uploaders: user can choose a different uploader on the fly
Diaporama: show low-res photo version
CAS Authentication: full rewrite, including ability to handle a ProxyTicket for further mounting operation
Added PostgreSQL & Sqlite support for new indexation features (req. by sync)
Security:
- Transformed auth.otp into an authfront, thus working with any auth backend.
- New plugin auth.duosecurity.
- New plugin for validating a disclaimer before using the platform [still exp.]
- Strengthen meta.mount security - by Christian Biamont & Patrik Lundin
New translations (italian, russian, german) by DepaMarco, Matsimon and Mtskar

[Upgrade Process]

- Archive installations (zip/tar.gz)
First switch the "Update Engine" channel (in the plugin options) to the "Development" channel.
From 5.3.2 (dev) : automatic with in-app upgrade, only files are impacted.
From 5.2.3 (stable) : automatic with in-app upgrade. HOWEVER, make sure to backup both your DB and your files.

- Linux packages (deb/rpm)
Package is available in the testing channel for both repositories.
Database migration is not performed automatically, please use this script to manually upgrade your DB.
REMARK ABOUT SHARING: Old share links will be still active, but user will have to migrate them manually. As the new ones allow to manually set the final hash of the link, users will have to stop public links, recreate them, and change the hash.

[Known Issues]

The new theme is not yet fully optimized for mobile devices, and not at all supported by IE8 and earlier
User dashboard sometimes need some manual resizing to have all panel appear.
>> See github repository to see the list of existing issues and help us resolve them!
Rewrite rules in Htaccess files are to be "translated" for other webservers (nginx, IIS). Again, contribs welcome!

Resplit LOG field into source, message and params - Close #483 Upgrade to be tested on PostgreSQL
Fix PowerFS charset problems
Should fix some errors with nodes parameter array when sending to background

Manual merge of #300 exif rotation
Editor.diaporama : exif rotation changes broke ImageViewer (extending Diaporama)
Massive refactoring: generalize usage of UserSelection object instead of always parsing the $httpVars["file"] variable. Prepend base64 encoded versions for auto-detection, should be backward-compatible.
Add new carrousel-like display mode for file list : horizontalScroll and fit:content
Folder "Recycle_bin" must be Hidden with attribute "H" if Windows OS
GUI : AjxpTabulator: new option uniqueTab will always replace existing editor in tab. FilesList: call fit:content inside resizeThumbnails() function Last compile
Ability to define many templates for the minisites (name must begin with minisite_) and user can choose. Sample template is Film Strip, super simple.

Introduce likeToLike and cleanLike in AJXP_Utils
getUsersCount auth.sql: use dibi ... again
Stop restraining search by putting ^
Download page
Minisites & publiclinks convergence, use simpleStoreGet/Set/List methods to store shares in the DB.
Fix pending login mechanism. Still somethig todo with various sessions opened.
fix Jumploader
fix ldap build group branch
json_encode object-like options when sending repository options.
Never store share meta on root node.
Massive rework of the shares storage & metadata => ability to build many links/workspace on each node, ability to move nodes without breaking (at least nodes directly shared, should be expanded to the children...), event forwarding to shared workspaces. To be tested extensively, particularly migration from old metadata format to new one. To be tested : URL shorteners.
One session per window in minisite makes it more convenient. Could be generalized to standard window.
Check if node exists when send unique file.
Do not use func()[0] for old php versions
AjxpPane image background: get defaultImage from parameter
ShareCenter: always write the RewriteRules in the htaccess. Set default images for download link.
ActionsManager / ActionsToolbar refactoring to handle a "local" datamodel. To be even more simplified if possible. Use it in RepositoryEditor to display a tab with all shares of the current edited workspace.
Change depandancy of action.cart
Conf/Auth driver : use a "ajxp.hidden" property to generally ignore all internal users created by minisites. Add powerfull methods to query repositories (directly in sql when possible).
Encapsulate new listRepositoriesWithCriteria() methods in ConfService. Use in ajxp_conf
Use new methods in action.share and access.ajxp_conf In ShareStore methods, pass userId instead of object.
Silently ignore wrong results in lucene.
Make sure the user object is not null - see previous commits.
Do not authorize ajxp_user repo by default ( = dashboard ) Disable "switch_to_dashboard_action" if repo is not allowed.
Update TPL access. Should be written at install time, along with the default charset.
Base for repository-specific authentication via a prompt dialog. Test in FTP by uncommenting the line. Could be used for the dropbox stuff.
Use html fullScreen
Fix RESTfull mkfile - too harsh sanitization clears the slashes in path
Fix minisite session detection (starts with AjaXplorer_Shared, not necessarily exactly that word)
Bug: dblclick was triggered twice on non-ie browsers
AbstractEditor last change: use className instead of class.
Update docblocks
Definitely set skipBubbling and skipCarousel to true by default - to be checked against mobile
Update ajxp_ role / plugin / repository editors.
Fix ajxp_conf layout resizing always showing some blank at the bottom, resize just after insertion.
Make sure share action does not appear in a menu
Fix minisite layouts initial loading
Create a static function to get ShareCenter instance (enabling the docblocks). Use it where possible. Start a readonly mode for ShareCenter.js
Display workspace alias, we could probably remove the unique ID
Test setting a user inside an AJXP_Node - could be used to impersonate a user instead of using logUser()
Carry on moving every actions / data concerning the shares inside the ShareCenter, out of ajxp_conf and presumabyl out of ajxp_user
Fix share actions
Clean ShareCenter
Fix passing 0 as related_object_id value to simpleStore
ShareCenter i18n / hide upload box for files.
Wrong call to list reload, triggers too much repainting

Do not "enlargeToOwn" the events - check that it has no side effect
Fix share watch
Fix #538 Missing node.read in access.fs when reading unique nodes
Set up a datamodel-specific ActionsToolbar via XML. No more reference to sharing in ajxp_conf. Use datamodel-specific listings in My Shares dashboard tab and load from ShareCenter.
Last compile
Replace /node+ by /dir+ in the rest params, very strange it was probably broken.
Fix error in array_merge messing up with numeric keys.
First implementation of Auth Front End, simple impl of a keystore-based auth for the REST api.
Move get_xml_registry (and alias "state" action) in core.conf instead of gui.ajax, should not be there.
Implement RestAPI token-based authentication. Last todo is to check the nonce is never reused. Add ORDER parameter in auth frontends plugins to make sure they are called in the correct order. Introduce a specific /pydio/ path to query API for non-workspaces actions. To be documented and checked when generating workspace slugs.
ApikeyPane
Rework startup. Set Encoding and server URI via installer. Activate syncable features, rest API and backbone router by default.
Try to load dynamic file encoding.php

Fix shared repositories listing problems
Re-adapt ftp special login screen in Auth.ftp driver
Forgot captcha Fix \ in new install web uri detection Adapt auth.multi (override login action)

Added Italian translation for 'access.ajxp_conf' plugin
Make sure URI is totally URLEncoded by calling urldecode / rawurlencode to compute the correct hash. Fix pydio/pydio-sync/#26
Italian translation
Hook node indexation to changes tracking. We should probably have a parent indexation core plugin, extended by lucene, change tracker, and elasticsearch. Make sure to exclude recycle_bin from indexation for synchro
Remove dependency of authfront.session_login to gui.ajax - we use protocol detection anyway.
Add an optional stream=true parameter to the changes request. Json data is return one per line, the result is not real json but it can be that way easily "streamed" by consuming clients.
Filehasher: publish rsync extension support through a plugin exposed parameter - document sdk methods for rest access.
Fix event sent when appending data to an existing file (must be an update instead of a create)

Fix canSwitchTo() method - make sure to include shared workspaces
Chase Pydio in users strings - Replace by APPLICATION_TITLE, except for About ...

Fix password-protected minisite behaviours
Fix minisite_session parameter management

Pydio 5.2.0 Release Note

This is a major stable release, upgrade is recommended. Please read below the detail of the changes.

License: Affero GPL
Copyright: Charles du Jeu 2014
Demo: https://demo.pyd.io/
Date: 21st, January 2014
Contributors: cdujeu, echampet, chusopr, joubertredrat, BlackLionPT, warhawk3407, andypmuc, Afterster, Ellega, TheLexus, terminal-addict, cfoellman, millsdude, bitstrings, thomasfrivold
Main new features

Tab-based editors: open editors in tabbed navigation, to work on many files at once.
New user Dashboard: displaying all personal parameters and custom data.
Faceted search: search files and folders by date, extension, date range, metadata, etc.
Sharing & emails
Update ShareCenter to create multiple links on a given file and associate an arbitrary tag data.
Add QRCode on shared links
Add an HTML layout for the emails, and pass a "main link" either by argument or from the main node of the notification
Ability to create personal contacts lists ("teams")
Add ENABLE_FOLDER_SHARING option in action.share, defaulting to true
Optional limit for number of shared users creation
Expand the Shared User creation form to fill user email, full name, send an email, etc.
Add a parameter to force old-school external email
Add a parameter to allow new users creation while sharing (true by default). Use AutoCompleter for AjxpMailer Send users_only in list_authorized_users to avoid retrieving groups.
GUI Performances
Quicker start Customize dialogbox with a className.
Use CSS animation when possible to make it lighter
Fix ResourcesManager : was loading css multiple times
Performance Hunting: divided by 3,5 the display of long list of files. Todo: monitor for side-effects
Minisite: remove the inlineToolbar, it creates big performances problems, we have to find an alternative for that in the mobile GUI as well.
Plugins
Comments feed
Rework metadata modifiers and Meta.user plugin. Implement a custom SelectBox choice. Should replace and close #255.
Selection cart and save search advanced.
Add avatar plugins (Gravatar and Libravatar)
Relayout admin dashboard
Simple implementation of WebODF viewer. Only as viewer for the moment, we have to get a way to send back the modif in a standard manner, probably by replacing the Runtime implementation.
Add plugin auth.radius
Add YOURLS shortener, with optional IDN support
Rework AJXP_Logger - expose all log levels - accept a variable number of argument
Add PostgreSQL database support
Improvements and API Changes

Make sure to show controls on video when opened in editor.
Shared users: inherit parent personalRole if the parameter is marked as inherit.
Allow administrators to disable WebDAV on individual repositories. This is necessary for repositories that depend on session credentials because clients such as Windows default WebDAV do not use sessions.
Implement WebDAV Basic authentication the same way as Digest.
FS: Pass __AJXP_ZIP_FLAT__ to makeZip function to force all files to be at level 0 Fix tabulator et splitter resizing issues Download Cart.
Use FeedStore instead of MetaStore to have recursive meta. Could be expanded to a more generic SQL-based metastore.
Impl #259 : if windows OS , alternative unoconv call.
Add office templates to Imagick support.
Rework "regexp" in listUsersPaginated / getUsersCount in class.sqlAuthDriver.php Now "^a" matches everything that start with a "a$" matches everything that end with a "^a$" matches exactly a (wasn't working) "a" matches everything that contains a (was matching exactly a)
Use HTML base tag instead of the previous complicated "travel_path_to_root" mechanism...
New access point for managing users self-service operations (currently reset password)
Make custom sort function to make sure users are sorted (fix #279)
New variable InputFilter::SANITIZE_FILENAME, to be less restrictive on the allowed characters than InputFilter::SANITIZE_HTML_STRICT. Particularly, allow commas in filename.
Login: trim username and password to avoid trailing and ending white space problems
Better API for get_my_feed. Ability to force recycle_bin creation in workspace share
Add node.share.create hooks
Add user.before_disconnect and user.after_disconnect hooks
Optionally attach a link to LogoWidget or RepositorySimpleLabel via ajxpOptions.
Fix minisite: > Display workspace description > Do not display label/description if no user logged.
API CHANGE: switch to nodes[] query parameters instead of file_0, file_1, file_2, etc. Unique "file" is still allowed though. Fix dblclick on IE10 and IE11, tested on WIN7 and 8
Add a stat_hash action to extend standard stat with the file hash.
Repository switch and loading optimization: avoid loading all available repository when we already know the repository ID. Should have a great impact on REST-based access, typically WebDAV.
New meta.syncable plugin keep tracks of all changes with a global revision number (inspired by couchdb mechanism)
Meta.filehasher: Add an optional caching mechanism to the full XML tree
Change how uploader.html depends on uploader.flex, should impact plugins ordering, but not activation.
Move copy operations into AbstractAccessDriver to factorize normal and cross-repository copies. Enable cross-repository copy for folders. To be tested extensively.
Strengthen again the security level of zoho plugin. Could be circumvented if people did not change their secret key.
Add two new parameters to the ls action, only playing for recursive case: max_depth and max_nodes. If activated ( = recursion is cut before the end), the folder nodes have a new property ajxp_has_children = true|false to decide whether client must recurse again or not.
Add an optional parameter for ZIP filenames encoding at creation. CP437 is a working value for Windows, but then archive is incorrect on mac... The best we can do to fix #10
LDAP: use ldap_sort instead of a custom sorter Fix filter differing in count and list users Fix groups listing - user object update when filter is empty
Add a parameter in LDAP to search users by another attribute
Check regexp on userId or userLabel ConfCenter: New parameter: get users from all groups (search them), and display whole list. ShareCenter: Sticking to userExists("write") is creating a local user instead of getting it from master auth.
Revert previous commit disabling users creation: add a parameter instead CACHE_MASTER_USERS_TO_SLAVE, set to true by default for backward compat.
In DEBUG mode, display stack trace in errors

This is implemented by default with Polling, an alternative WebSocket implementation is still in experimentation.
Mailer is now part of the core (using phpmail-lite)
User feed : store events and alerts as a feed : this requires SQL and is not enabled by default for the moment.
Pass host & port to ws-server.php
Extract the queues management into specific plugins mq.*  (remove the worker queues from conf plugins, remove the instant queues from core.mq)
Meta.quota uses instant message (hook msg.instant) if active.

[action.share] Do NOT override sharing options if re-editing
[action.share] Try displaying USER_DISPLAY_NAME whenever possible
[action.share] Set the resolveAsParent flag on user before getting the PATH option, to make sure it's correctly resolved for computing
[action.share] Make sure to avoid // in public link
[action.share] Make sure we don't read a non existing file (seems to hog CPU)

shared metadata on content update.
XSD Accept special chars in component_config className attribute (className::ajxpPaneId)
Send Content-Encoding:none header to force closing connection
Add a start test for Output Buffering
Fix metastore security scope and metadata cleaning
First pass on virtual roots (should be provided by user roles)

Clear stat cache before sending node.change event.
Make sure to force IE9 in standard mode
[phpunit] Organize PHPUnit Tests
[index.lucene] Special * query to send whole arborescence (performances test)
New variable AJXP_GROUP_PATH_FLAT to avoid seeing subgroups folders
Save digest HA1 on password update (if TRANSMIT_CLEAR_PASS is set to true), to avoid having to re-enter a
password for WebDAV >> To validate
Utils : do not sanitize HTML for textarea fields / Pass these fields value as CDATA, not attribute.
Make sure to send node.change event AFTER download (otherwise it triggers an output_buffer).
Set doc/ppt/xls mimes in core, not only zoho
Apply ultreia suggestion to trim only null characters (ultreia)
Trigger upload directly when ios-client / apache

PERFORMANCES
Perf hunting : introduce an accessible cache for full registry queries
Perf hunting : fullMetaCache broken by alternating global and local cache. Always use ajxpNode->isLeaf()
instead of is_file / is_dir.
The getTrueSizeOnFileSystem is VERY time consuming, we could maybe use a cache. The long part is now located in renderAjxpNode() and xmlEntities() function...


------ 4.3.0 Release note

AUTH/CONF COMPONENTS MASSIVE REWRITE
. Groups implementation : users can now be part of “groups“, and a user can be administrator of a sub-group only. Repositories and roles can be marked with a given group as well, making them accessible only to the users of the group and below. This is a good step toward multi-tenancy. Groups are also accessible for sharing : ability to share with a whole group at once.
. Roles generalization : The role concept is now a generic container for a extended set of data : ACL, but also plugins Parameters and plugins actions set to be disabled. Roles can be manually created, but a user will by default inherit its rights from a default "personal" role, and from roles attached to its groups. This is making the configurations/ACL ultra-flexible, and you can for example set different configs parameters for two different groups, and then override these for a specific user if necessary.  These parameters and actions can also be applied to a chosen "scope" for repositories : All Repositories, Shared Repositories, or each repository one by one. See this page for more info : http://ajaxplorer.info/documentation/administration/4b-configs-roles-ajaxplorer-5/
. The old "CUSTOM_DATA" fields defined in the conf drivers options are now actually brought by plugins manifest, and a "scope" attribute allows to attach these custom fields to either the users, the groups, or the roles (or all of them).
. Roles (and by extension users and groups), Repositories and Plugins now have their own brand new editors.
. A “lock" property of the users can trigger a predefined action just after login, useful for either forcing pass change, or setting a GUC to validate. If set to "logout", the user just cannot log.

WEBDAV COMPONENT REPLACEMENT
The WebDAV component, previously powered by ezComponent, was entirely replaced by SabreDAV, which is by far a more active and stable project. As a result, webDAV should be working way better, litmus tests are passing 100%, even with MacOS Finder! As a bonus, we added the possibility to point to the parent url (/shares/) with a listing of all available repositories depending on the user logged. Finally, a WEBDAV_BROWSER_LISTING option allows you to access the very simple webdav list directly in the web browser.
WARNING : THIS NOW ADD A REQUIREMENT TO PHP5.3!

NEW PLUGINS
[access.hpcloud] First implementation of HPCloud Object Storage access, based on their PHP bindings + patch. See if possible to send back the changes.
[cypher.encfs] Experimental implementation of encfs : dynamically create / mount / umount an encfs filesystem. Nice trick to handle the creation via STDIN. Requires web-server user to have sudo access to encfs and encfsctl commands. Implementation is using specific folder prefixes and node filtering. New "force_copy_delete" parameter in fsAccessDriver when moving directories from/to a mounted folder. Automatically unmount all folders at logout/repo_switch, pass the XML template & password as plugin configurations. Remind to add www-data or equivalent to sudoers for encfs and encfsctl commands.
[metastore.xattr] XAttr metastore implementation, seems to be working quite well. Requires xattr, libattr (libattr1-dev on debian), and pecl xattr extension.
[meta.watch] Update Mailer, new meta "watch" for watching a folder and getting notification on it. How to watch a root folder? Share and Watch together
[core.mailer] Generic plugin for sending email. Unique implementation yet is using phpmailer-lite.
[core.notification] USE_QUEUE parameter in NotificationCenter / Base for notification templates via i18n library
[mailer.phpmailer-lite] Mailer implementation


PLUGINS FIXES
[meta.git] Fix performChecks function
[editor.diaporama] Compute image ratio using JS when not available via metadata.
[editor.diaporama] Optimize for remote wrappers by caching references to real file whenever possible.
[editor.diaporama] PThumb : deprecated join calls

[Access.dropbox] better error handling (could trigger a memory fault)
[log.text] : send syslog error when recursive problem.
[access.fs] Catch opendir failed call error / Remove unused countFiles call for recycle bin.
[editor.soundmanager] : totally disable for IE < 9 .
[conf.serial] Fixes in conf.serial/AJXP_User and in ldapAuthDriver for case sensitivity problems.
[action.scheduler] Add a log in fakeLongTask
[auth.ldap] Do not initialize the LDAP Connection in init() function, otherwise it's triggered for no reason most of the time.
[action.share] Resolve AJXP_USER as parent only in a controlled environnement > Better logs for shared links actions (do not mix with author login anymore)
[meta.filehasher] Fix : filling /tmp/ dir with filehasher_patch files...
[conf.sql] New table ajxp_simple_store for multi-purpose storage. This is getting closer to JCR / PHPCR approach !!!
[meta.quota] Implement SoftQuota
[meta.filehasher] Meta.filehasher : remove rsync actions to "advertise" the fact that rsync is not on the server.


CORE FRAMEWORK (PluginService & Controller)
New variables filters AJXP_GROUP_PATH, AJXP_ALLOW_SUB_PATH
Ability to load manifests contribs including external files (for listing actions).
Add ajxp_folder mime_type to "ls" action, to allow the actions discrimination by mime types for folders as well. To be checked for side-effects!
Set GROUP_PATH as repository standard option.
LoadRegistryContribution only when building the registry - Try filtering options with role parameters.
Ability to depend on a type of plugin being present (mailer+)
Basis for attaching binary data to users/roles - Handle images for avatars
Add node.read hook wherever possible
Abstract updateUserObject() function can be call to let the AUTH drivers enrich the CONF users object, implementation sample on LDAP, by automatically mapping ldap attributes to CUSTOM_DATA_ parameters.
Fix exception loop
Fix logger : when using CLI, REMOTE_ADRESS not available, display PHP_CLI instead.

CORE UI (gui.ajax)
Actions : new attribute evalMetadata on selectionContext
MetaStoreProvider interface now declares an inherentMetaMove() method to be implemented.
ShareCenter : Update node metadata on before_change instead of change, otherwise automoving metastore will move metadata before checking the node.
Move Conf / Auth group methods to abstract classes, SQL conf to be implemented. Code cleaning.
ShareCenter : Handle group sharing from start to end.
In FormManager, ability to set a field readonly .
IE : always LoadAutoLoadResources() after registry is loaded
Connexion : display error message, not error object.
IE XPath : set SelectionLanguage property to be able to use contains() expression.
Display a NEXT instead of OK for create_user and create_repository

[access.smb] Make sure to register smb:// wrapper (bug in cross-repository copy)
[access.smb] Apply Thomas Oettli tweaks (new DOMAIN parameter).
[access.ajxp_confDriver] Not very nice, but working, make sure to register meta.svn & meta.git after the others (will trigger the hooks accordingly) @todo : generic reflexion on the hooks/plugins ordering.
[action.scheduler] Missing xmlEntities call on repositories list, could break the interface.
[action.scheduler] Make sure the folder is also initialize on unserialization
[meta.quota] Fix shell epression used for computing quota on Darwin
[core.auth] Wrong ajax response on pass-change error, reported by @ultreia
[AJXP_Utils] Fix from @mattlef : avoid exception on empty extension filename

[CLI & ASSOCIATED TEST]
CLI : detect / configure / use COM WScript.Shell to enable command line on IIS. Require giving correct rights to the cmd.exe executable.
Typo error totally breaking the PHPCLI test.
Test CLI : more tests on safe_mode & exec detection to be sure it will not crash

[WebDAV]
Disable locking for the moment, triggering too much random upload problem
[Quotas] webDAV and quota checking
[WebDAV] Fix error if a repository has no metastore
Conf.sql :  getRepositoryByAlias was simply broken, making webDAV fail when using conf.sql

This is a major stable release that includes numerous bugfixes from the 4.1.0 and a lot of new features.

[NEW FEATURES]
Auth.multi driver       : Implement an alternative MODE, instead of proposing the various drivers to the user, consider one is the master (typically ldap) and the other is the local alternative (typically serial) to allow creating shared users.
Action.scheduler        : a generic CRON-LIKE scheduler triggering AjaXplorer actions in background. Only one call needs to be added to the cron to trigger the scheduler
Share engine            : Add an optional Downloads Limit on generated links to auto-expire after x downloads.
Default repository      : Add an option for forcing default repository at login.
Quota implementation    : New hook before_create / Pass new size when possible in before_change and before_create
meta.file_hasher        : Store md5_mtime to make sure some changes were not missed, recompute if not sure

Automated build     : exclude some under-used or very specific plugins from the standard build : access.demo, access.jsapi, access.wms, auth.cmsms, auth.phpbb, editor.codepress (deprecated), log.syslog
Replication         : Ability to replicate groups of fields in the standard form kit.
Config files        : New (optional) way of encoding serial files using JSON formatting. We may switch massively to this format, as it's much more easy to hack manually (but would have to check performances before).
Refactoring         : Deport login/logout and related actions inside AbstractAuthDriver instead of root index.php file
Autoloader          : search interfaces defined in core plugins
Refactoring         : New core.metastore plugin, defining the MetaStoreProvider interface & the AJXP_METADATA_ constants
